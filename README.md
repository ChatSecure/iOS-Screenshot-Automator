iOS-Screenshot-Automator
========================

Batch-creates screenshots for all iOS devices in every language you define, ready for immediate upload in iTunes Connect. Uses and integrates with UIAutomation from Apple. Also great for unit testing.

The script is based on UIAutomation to navigate the app and take the screenshots.

Define which languages and simulator types you want to use in the "run"-file. 

If you want to set the carrier name manually, take a look at the "changeCarrierName" file
